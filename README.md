## how to run the game for your self

The best way is to clone the repository go to main.py file and in a IDE(integrated development environment) like VScode or others or in command prompt, first install libs. in requiarments than run the main file and the game should start up and should be working normaly, yup and if you dont have instaled the module(libralies) nedeed look at the dependencies file there will be all the outside libs you need to download
Enjoy your plaing

## If you want to help me don't hasitate:
I'm always open to knowing more and well as I sayed I'm still learning, so if you want to help me don't hasitate and fork my code but always when you make something new or want to emprove something what was mine code just properly comment it before commiting, thanks
