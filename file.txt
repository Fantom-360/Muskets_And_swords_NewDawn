            health 20 hp points, if lost 4 hp it will lose one musketeer
            attack power/Mdmg = chance to hit = how many musketeers left #so if the musketeers are 3 the chance is 1 - 3 Mdmg if there is 5 musketeers the chance is 3 - 5 and so on
            sword attack/Sdmg = chance to hit =
