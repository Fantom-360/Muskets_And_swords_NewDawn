        file with images:
                        troops - 5 color variants for oponents - red - defaul1 - df for player
                                                                 blue - defalut2 - df for enemy

                        cannons - same as troops with color
        abilities:
        troops: movement 2 tiles per turn, when on road 3 tiles but only on road
                health 20 hp points, if lost 4 hp it will lose one musketeer
                attack power/Mdmg = chance to hit = how many musketeers left #so if the musketeers are 3 the chance is 1 - 3 Mdmg if there is 5 musketeers the chance is 3 - 5 and so on
                sword attack/Sdmg = chance to hit = 


make the drawing func that it will blit the picture ito the poligon also when drawing it will or had to have as an parameter the Hex_node class bc from that we can call on each hex that is going to be drawn pass the image i want to be in the polygon hex shape, so to specify everything 1. re do the drawing func a little bit to make images on the hex_node where it is 2. alter the grid drawing to firstly crating the graph abstractly to ensure we have the Hex_nodes than pass the coordinates and using my equation to from the q, r coords do the x and y coords and than drawing them with the proper images 3. this also opent that wen i create a dikt with the graph abstract i can easely had code some leves and then pasing the abstract graph to make draw the hex grid using my equation and the Hex_node to blit the pictures 




if the neibor is going to row htat has the column num % 2 the we need to alter the neibors a little also wehn we are going back but we need to connect it firstly
