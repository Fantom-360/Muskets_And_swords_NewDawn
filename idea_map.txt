                                                                                     Sprink - green


                                                specialiti you can break the ice on winter maps
    file with images:
                        troops - 5 color variants for oponents - red - defaul1 - df for player
                                                                 blue - defalut2 - df for enemy
                                                                 green
                                                                 yellow
                                                                 brown
                        cannons - same as troops with color
    abilities:
    troops: movement 2 tiles per turn, when on road 3 tiles but only on road
            health 20 hp points, if lost 4 hp it will lose one musketeer
            attack power/Mdmg = chance to hit = how many musketeers left #so if the musketeers are 3 the chance is 1 - 3 Mdmg if there is 5 musketeers the chance is 3 - 5 and so on
            sword attack/Sdmg = chance to hit = 






hexagonal grid: add: main grid + try to figure how to cords between them 
        first idea: make it that when i say how many row it create rows the for loop should only go for 2 times one for the 3 hexagons and the second one for the socond row of grids
        cord fugurated, now proble return them on the right hexagon
        create test figure circle|tryangle on hex by cords on hex centre

        selcting unit will be thing of counting an distance between mouse pos and center of hex to ensure that we can get of that rounding stuff 
        also i want to ensure that the code is easy to read so I'm still making my self go more further the rabbit hole on the theme of making things with hexeagos
        and starting the project over 

        hexagonal grid should be drawn normaly but conecting the hex grid for further progress of pathfinding and moving from one to another 


        but well I'm still trying to figure out some thing i dont stil fully understand so it wil be a lot of fun and it is a lot of fun

        "ohh my progress is so slow bc ||i miss my loved one|| they are somewhere and the night are so lonely"




basic same long side hexagon: made from 6 same tryangles each side of tryangle is 60Â° and every side is same, so radius = side
