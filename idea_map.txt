                        troops - 5 color variants for oponents - red - defaul1 - df for player
                                                                 blue - defalut2 - df for enemy
                                                                 green
                                                                 yellow
                                                                 brown
                        cannons - same as troops with color
    abilities:
    troops: movement 2 tiles per turn, when on road 3 tiles but only on road
            health 20 hp points, if lost 4 hp it will lose one musketeer
            attack power/Mdmg = chance to hit = how many musketeers left #so if the musketeers are 3 the chance is 1 - 3 Mdmg if there is 5 musketeers the chance is 3 - 5 and so on
            sword attack/Sdmg = chance to hit = 






hexagonal grid: add: main grid + try to figure how to cords between them 
        first idea: make it that when i say how many row it create rows the for loop should only go for 2 times one for the 3 hexagons and the second one for the socond row of grids
        cord fugurated, now proble return them on the right hexagon
        create test figure circle|tryangle on hex by cords on hex centre




basic same long side hexagon: made from 6 same tryangles each side of tryangle is 60Â° and every side is same, so radius = side
